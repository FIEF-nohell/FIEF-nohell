# hey, i'm noel

i make stuff. sometimes it even works.  
usually involves web apps, tools i wish existed, and questionable life choices.

> dev by day, dev by night. caffeine is a constant.

i like dark themes, clean code, and chaos (in controlled doses).  
ask me about my "why did i build this" projects.

🛠️ building tools i use  
🔥 breaking things i love  
📈 occasionally learning from it
